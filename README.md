## This is a working example for Onion architecture accompanying the blog post "Onion Architecture with Spring Boot"

### Intro
This SpringBoot maven project is part of my [blog post](https://blog.mimacom.com/onion-architecture-spring-boot/) where you could find not only explanation for it, but also theoretical background for:
- What is the history of onion architecture
- How you could leverage Onion Architecture with Spring Boot as a mainstream technology in your company

### Prerequisites:
- JDK11+

Have fun and do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions!

### Test the REST Apis

1. Start the project
2. Start in browser: http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html#/shopping-list-controller
3. From shopping-list-controller use the following API's:
3.1. Create a new ShoppingList and copy the retrieved URL
3.2. Add item to the ShoppingList
3.3. Get the total price 
   
(!) Not that the shipping costs under 100.00 units is extra 10.00 units
