### Few words about the illustrated example

How to test the ShoppingList's APIs?

1. Start the project and navigate in your browser to: http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html#/shopping-list-controller
2. From shopping-list-controller use the following API's:
2.1. Create a new ShoppingList and copy the retrieved URL
2.2. Add item to the ShoppingList
2.3. Get the total price 
   
(!) Not that the shipping costs under 100.00 units is extra 10.00 units

Have fun and do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions!
