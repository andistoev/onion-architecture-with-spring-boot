## This is an example how to apply Onion Architecture accompanying the blog post "Onion Architecture with Spring Boot"

### Intro
This SpringBoot maven project is part of my [blog post](https://blog.mimacom.com/onion-architecture-spring-boot/) where you could find not only explanation for it, but also theoretical background for:
- What is the history of Hexagonal-like Architectures
- Implementation tips helping to apply the Onion Architecture with Spring Boot

### Prerequisites:
- JDK11+

### Few words about the illustrated example

How to test the ShoppingList's APIs?

After you have started the project locally, navigate to: [http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html#/shopping-list-controller](http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html#/shopping-list-controller) and then use the following end points:
- Create a new ShoppingList and copy the retrieved shoppingListId (UUID);
- Add item to the ShoppingList;
- Get its total price.

ðŸ”” Did you notice that the final price is increased with 10 more credits than you may have expected? Yes, this is the shiny business rule to have shipping costs of 10 credits (it will become free of charge if the shopping list has items for more than 100 credits). You may have already forgotten, but the software implemented with onion architecture will never forget about it! ðŸ˜‰

Have fun and do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions!
